The datasets in the "data" folder along with the 4 files in the src folder (animate_dataset, utils, console_utils and settings) and the subfolder simulator was from https://github.com/EdsterG/learning_grps 

The rest of the code in src folder was coded by me, some based on the animate_dataset to use the dataset provided by them.

Most of the code is meant to be run on a NVIDIA graphics card.

Some of the code needs a dataset argument to be run

python3 [filename] [datasetname]
